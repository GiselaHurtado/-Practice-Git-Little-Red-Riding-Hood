        <h2>Part 1: Little Red Riding</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a small village on the edge of a forest, there lived a little girl known as Little Red Riding Hood. 
        She was called this because she always wore a red cloak with a hood that her grandmother had made for her.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: A Task for Red Riding Hood</h2>
    <p>One sunny morning, Red Riding Hood’s mother said, “Your grandmother is feeling unwell. Please take her this basket of cakes and a little pot of butter.” 
       Red Riding Hood was very happy to help and set off to her grandmother’s house.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: The Wolf</h2>
        <p>As Red Riding Hood walked through the woods, she met a wolf. The wolf wanted to eat her up but knew he couldn’t because some woodcutters were nearby. Instead, he asked her where she was going. Innocently, she told him about her sick grandmother’s house.</p>
